        After the wireframes, I jumped to Adobe XD to make the mockups and the
        final prototype. I incorporated the comments made by users from the
        first phase. I suggested this new layout to 6 new testers. I reiterated
        it once, until I reached a <strong>100% success rate</strong>

          navigation bar to keep on visiting the app.

          search bar. We replace the "see all" link with an icon allowing the
          analysis of expenses, corresponding to one of the icons at the top
          right.

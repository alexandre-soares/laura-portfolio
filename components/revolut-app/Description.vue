      "THE NEW REVOLUT UPDATE S**KS" This is what I have been hearing all 2020
      long. Dull colours, messy information, Revolut team managed to transform
      their initial great app in a nightmare for their user.

      With this UX research, I’ll try to see what’s wrong with the main features
      and suggest a new design. The goal being "Don’t let me think".

        to spend one hour on zoom to cover all the missing points of this

      Regarding the method, I wanted to be as close as possible to user needs
      with a <strong>human-centred</strong> approach and I used
      <strong>Lean UX</strong> design thinking. For user research, I relied on
      Google statistics showing that 85% of major usability problems can be
      solved with feedback from just 5 people.
      <strong>Guerrilla</strong> usability testing is therefore perfect for this
      case study!

      The project was a challenge started in 2017 in Tokyo. When I considered to
      stop my activity as an eyewear designer, I gave myself one month to learn
      how to be an UX and UI designer and design the app DOKOGO, from the logo
      to the prototype and the promoting video. And I made it!
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      DOKOGO is a complete mobile application allowing the user in lack of idea
      to choose a destination according to various parameters such as his
      budget, his travel time, his means of transport, his goal etc.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      DOKOGO is pun composed of the Japanese word "doko" meaning "where" and the
      English word "go": where to go ?
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Two videos were produced to complete the project: one to show the process
      of creating a prototype for a mobile application and a marketing concept
      video.

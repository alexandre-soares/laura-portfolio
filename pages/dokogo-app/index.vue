                The project was a challenge started in 2017 in Tokyo. When I
                considered to stop my activity as an eyewear designer, I gave
                myself one month to learn how to be an UX and UI designer and
                design the app DOKOGO, from the logo to the prototype and the
                promoting video. And I made it!
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                DOKOGO is a complete mobile application allowing the user in
                lack of idea to choose a destination according to various
                parameters such as his budget, his travel time, his means of
                transport, his goal etc.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                DOKOGO is pun composed of the Japanese word "doko" meaning
                "where" and the English word "go": where to go ?
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Two videos were produced to complete the project: one to show
                the process of creating a prototype for a mobile application and
                a marketing concept video.

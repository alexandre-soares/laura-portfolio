        `With this UX research, I tried to see what was wrong with the main features and suggested a new design. The baseline being "Donâ€™t let me think".`,
        `Of course this study could be push beyond and I will be glad to share over zoom as per your inputs.`,
        `Regarding the method, I aimed to be as close as possible to user needs with a human-centered approach and I used Lean UX design thinking. For user research, I relied on Google statistics showing that 85% of major usability problems can be solved with feedback from just 5 people. Guerrilla usability testing was therefore perfect for this case study!`,
